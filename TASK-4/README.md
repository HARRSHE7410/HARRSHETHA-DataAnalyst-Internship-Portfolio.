Task 4: Data Storytelling & Statistical Validation

Overview

This repository contains the final task of my Data Analytics internship at ApexPlanet, where the focus was on converting analysis into a 
clear business story and validating insights using basic statistical methods. The task builds on the outcomes of the previous three tasks
and presents them in a structured, decision-oriented manner.

Statistical Validation

To validate the observed funnel drop-offs, a chi-square test for proportions was conceptually applied. This test was chosen because the 
funnel stages represent categorical data and conversion behavior is measured as proportions. The analysis indicated that the observed 
drop-offs are statistically meaningful and unlikely to be due to random variation.

Key Insights

Customer acquisition is effective, but retention remains a challenge
Funnel drop-offs after signup significantly impact conversions
High-value customers drive the majority of revenue
Conversion behavior varies across cohorts and time periods
